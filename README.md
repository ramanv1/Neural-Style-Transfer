# Neural-Style-Transfer

We create a class to perform Neural Style Transfer. The class can make use of two pre-trained models viz. VGG19 and VGG16. We can set our style layers, content layers, change the weights of style loss, content loss and total variation loss. We also have the option of working with different optimizers such as Adam, RMSprop and SGD.
We demonstrate the use of the class in a jupyter notebook.
